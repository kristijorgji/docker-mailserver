# How to connect with Thunderbird

This guide will show you how to connect to your newly created mailserver with Thunderbird.

The logic and steps are the same across all clients, but as our favorite is Thunderbird we use that one in this example.

1 Right-click on the left sidebar then choose `Settings`

![open thunderbird settings](./1-open-settings.png)

2 Add the new account, in our example `me@example.com`
![add the new account](./2-add-new-account.png) 

The most important thing here is using port `143`

3 Finally add outgoing smtp server which will allow you to send emails

![add outgoing smtp server](./3-add-smtp-server.png)


That is all, now Thunderbird will ask for your password and afterward have fun receiving and sending emails!
